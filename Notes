Raspberry PI measures every n minutes, uploads to S3 bucket

* configure time synchronization on PI

AWS Lambda function is triggered every n minutes
* checks the timestamp of the last temperature reading and alerts if it is too old
* checks the temperature itself and alerts if it is too low


Cloudformation
* (done) create data S3 bucket
* (done) create IAM Role with lambda execution rights and access to the S3 bucket
* (done) create Lambda function
* (done) create event (trigger) for lambda - bucket update
* create user for pi push, download key
* check if the log group name in cloudwatch can be controlled somehow
* create lambda alias for published lambda (nice to have)
* Assign dead letter queue to lambda: SNS topic, subscribe via SMS
